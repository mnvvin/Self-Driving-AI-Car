# Self-Driving-AI-Car
Self-Driving AI Car Model 🚗🤖

This Self-Driving AI Car Model is an advanced project leveraging Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning to autonomously navigate a simulated or real-world environment. The model integrates sensor data, camera feeds, and machine learning algorithms to make real-time driving decisions, ensuring safety and efficiency.

🔍 Key Features:
Perception System: Object detection using YOLOv8 and OpenCV for identifying vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs.
Lane Detection: Computer Vision techniques to maintain lane discipline and handle lane changes.
Path Planning: Shortest and safest route calculation using A algorithm* or Dijkstra's algorithm.
Control System: Smooth acceleration, braking, and steering through a PID controller.
Simulation: Tested on CARLA Simulator to validate performance before real-world deployment.

🚀 Technologies Used:
Languages: Python
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

👨‍💻 How to Run:
Clone the repository
Install required dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt)
Launch the simulation (python main.py)
